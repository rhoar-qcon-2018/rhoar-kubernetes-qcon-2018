This document is designed by Deven Phillips, Jeremy Davis, and Ram Maddali.

<<<
= Overview
Microservices and Containers have changed the entire landscape of software
development in the last few years. We are now able to decompose our development
work into smaller and more digestible components which are easier to understand
and easier to split amongst developer teams for better parallel workflow.

Just as Linux has pretty much won the hearts and minds of most developers
for the operating system of the cloud, Kubernetes has become the de facto
standard for orchestrating containers at scale.

In this workshop, you will learn how to leverage Containers and Kubernetes
to build a productive DevOps workflow using Kubernetes (Wrapped by OpenShift)
to build, test, deploy, and validate microservices quickly and reliably.

Some of the tools we will leverage in this workshop are listed below:

== OpenShift and Kubernetes Overview
.OpenShift Container Platform Architecture Overview
[#image-architecture]
[caption="Figure 1: "]
image::architecture_overview.png[Architecture]

Kubernetes (and by extension OpenShift) is a system, based on microservices, for orchestrating
containerized applications across one or more hosts. Just as the kernel schedules work
in an operating system, the orchestrator schedules work in a cluster. Continuing with that
analogy, kernels arbitrate access to resources like networking and disk, Kubernetes (a.k.a. K8s)
provides access to software-defined networks and storage.

Beyond the OS analogy though, K8s (and even more so OpenShift) can be a platform
which abstracts some of the tedium of managing applications away for developers and
administrators. The real power of K8s is in allowing for centralized and automated
management of things like network controls, encryption, auditing, monitoring, logging,
etc... Moving these functions to the platform simplifies the writing, understanding, and
debugging of software.

=== Containers

Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in
resource-isolated processes. Containers allow you to easily package an application's code, configurations, and
dependencies into easy to use building blocks that deliver environmental consistency, operational efficiency, developer
productivity, and version control. Containers can help ensure that applications deploy quickly, reliably, and
consistently regardless of deployment environment. Containers also give you more granular control over resources giving
your infrastructure improved efficiency. <<awsecs>>

=== Master
.Kubernetes Master
[#image-k8s-master]
[caption="Figure 2: "]
image::k8s_master.png[Master]

The master is responsible for exposing the application program interface (API), scheduling the deployments and managing
the overall cluster. Each node runs a container runtime, such as Docker or rkt, along with an agent that communicates
with the master. The node also runs additional components for logging, monitoring, service discovery and optional
add-ons. Nodes are the workhorses of a Kubernetes cluster. They expose compute, networking and storage resources to
applications. Nodes can be virtual machines (VMs) running in a cloud or bare metal servers running within the data
center. <<tnsk8s>>

=== Nodes
.Kubernetes Node
[#image-k8s-node]
[caption="Figure 3: "]
image::k8s_node.png[Master]

A node provides the runtime environments for containers. Each node in a Kubernetes cluster has the required services to
be managed by the master. Nodes also have the required services to run pods, including the Docker service, a kubelet,
and a service proxy. <<rhocpn>>

==== Kubelet
Each node has a kubelet that updates the node as specified by a container manifest, which is a YAML file that describes
a pod. The kubelet uses a set of manifests to ensure that its containers are started and that they continue to run.

==== Service Proxy
Each node also runs a simple network proxy that reflects the services defined in the API on that node. This allows the
node to do simple TCP and UDP stream forwarding across a set of back ends.

=== FluentD
The FluentD agent allows for streaming of container output into the logging backend of your choice (EFK in OpenShift).

=== Services
A Kubernetes service serves as an internal load balancer. It identifies a set of replicated pods in order to proxy the
connections it receives to them. Backing pods can be added to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the service
remains consistently available, enabling anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent address.
The default service clusterIP addresses are from the OpenShift Container Platform internal network and they are used to
permit pods to access each other.

=== Pods
The Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute
unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed. Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance (physical or
virtual) to a container. Each pod is allocated its own internal IP address, therefore owning its entire port space, and
containers within pods can share their local storage and networking.

=== OpenShift Extensions To Kubernetes

==== Container Registry (OpenShift Only)
OpenShift Container Platform provides an integrated container registry called OpenShift Container Registry (OCR) that
adds the ability to automatically provision new image repositories on demand. This provides users with a built-in
location for their application builds to push the resulting images.

==== Web Console
The OpenShift Container Platform web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser. Developers can use the
web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents of projects.

==== Logging (EFK)
OpenShift deploys a complete EFK (ElasticSearch, FluentD, Kibana) stack which is used to aggregate logs and metrics
from each Pod. Output from containers can be kept according to the configured preferences.

==== Software Defined Networking
OpenShift Container Platform uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide a unified cluster network
that enables communication between pods across the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This pod network is
established and maintained by the OpenShift SDN, which configures an overlay network using Open vSwitch (OVS).

==== Multitenancy
The ovs-multitenant plug-in provides project-level isolation for pods and services. Each project receives a unique
Virtual Network ID (VNID) that identifies traffic from pods assigned to the project. Pods from different projects
cannot send packets to or receive packets from pods and services of a different project.

==== Container Native Storage
Container-Native Storage for OpenShift Container Platform is built around three key technologies:

* OpenShift provides the platform as a service (PaaS) infrastructure based on Kubernetes container management. Basic
  OpenShift architecture is built around multiple master systems where each system contains a set of nodes.
* Red Hat Gluster Storage provides the containerized distributed storage based on Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1.3
  container. Each Red Hat Gluster Storage volume is composed of a collection of bricks, where each brick is the
  combination of a node and an export directory.
* Heketi provides the Red Hat Gluster Storage volume life cycle management. It creates the Red Hat Gluster Storage
  volumes dynamically and supports multiple Red Hat Gluster Storage clusters.

==== Routes
Routes allow OpenShift Container Platform route exposes a service at a host name, like `www.example.com`, so that
external clients can reach it by name.

==== Templates
A template describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation
by OpenShift Container Platform. The objects to create can include anything that users have permission to create within
a project, for example services, build configurations, and deployment configurations. A template may also define a set
of labels to apply to every object defined in the template.

==== Source-2-Image & Build Configs
Source-2-Image (S2I) is a concept in OpenShift which allows the Master node in the cluster to accept a GIT URL, clone the
repository into a *_builder_* pod, inspect the contents and detect the type of project, then use the detected project
type to automatically build that project into a container. For example, a Java project with a Maven POM file will be
built using `mvn package` and the resulting JAR will be used configured to be the entrypoint for that container.

Build Configs in OpenShift allow us to go several steps further than S2I for more complex requirements. A build config
can customize how an S2I build is executed by specifying a `strategy` and additional parameters like the source
container or secrets which might be needed for the build.

Finally, build configs which use the `pipeline` strategy can be automatically wired into a Jenkins deployment running
inside of the OpenShift cluster. The project will then be built via a Jenkinsfile (usually in the root of the project).
The Jenkinsfile and pipeline strategy provide us nearly limitless control over how our builds are managed.

==== Projects
A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the central vehicle by which access to resources
for regular users is managed. A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation
from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators, or if allowed to create projects,
automatically have access to their own projects.

==== Security
OpenShift implements a number of security enhancements over stock Kubernetes.

* Default to non-root containers
* Network isolation via Software-Defined Networking
* Improved Roles, Groups, User management
* Integration with Certificate Authorities and Identity Management

==== Metrics & Monitoring (Prometheus/Hawkular/Heapster)
OpenShift can be deployed along with Prometheus monitoring git stand Hawkular metrics tracking. When deployed these services provide
continuous monitoring of basic application information like latency, CPU utilization, and memory consumption. Developers
can also take advantage of these services to publish their own customized metrics to the services from their applications
using the Hawkular/Prometheus APIs.

== Let's Collaborate And Be Social!
We have a created a Gitter ORG for this workshop. Anything which comes up during the workshop which we need to share
will all of the participants will be pasted into those channels.

* https://gitter.im/rhoar-qcon-2018/Lobby[Lobby] - General discussion and posts for all attendees
* https://gitter.im/rhoar-qcon-2018/Questions[Questions] - Ask Questions Here is we are not getting to you quickly enough
* https://gitter.im/rhoar-qcon-2018/Feedback[Feedback] - Tell us what you liked (or didn't, S'ok we have thick skin)!

== Conference WiFi SUCKS!
Those of you who have been to many conferences are aware that conference wifi is terrible, slow, and overtaxed. To help prevent the slow conference wifi from slowing us down too much, we'll be using a local Nexus server for Maven artifacts. This will allow everyone to get cached versions of the required artifacts for local development without overstraining the hotel's WiFi.

== Exercise 1: Load A Complete DevOps Environment In Kubernetes

[NOTE]
====
While some of the process we will show here is specific to OpenShift, all of the same sorts of capabilities can
be achieved using https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm] in stock Kubernetes (Without the nice UI)
https://blog.openshift.com/from-templates-to-openshift-helm-charts/[From OpenShift Templates To Helm Charts]
====

=== Download/Install OpenShift Client Tools
You can always download the latest OpenShift CLI tools from Github https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[HERE]

. Download the correct release for your platform
. Extract the binary executable from the archive file
. Place the `oc` command somewhere that it can be added to your executable PATH
. Update your PATH to include the location of the `oc` command
.. On *NIX systems, you can update your .<shell>rc files to add the location for `oc`
.. On Windows systems, it is recommended to extract the archive into your *Documents* directory and add that folder to your PATH

=== Clone The Repositories

To simplify the process of getting all of the projects, we have created a Git project with Submodules. You can checkout the whole thing by running:

.Clone Workshop Materials
[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/rhoar-qcon-2018/rhoar-kubernetes-qcon-2018.git --recurse-submodules
----

.Set Cluster Username
[source, bash]
----
export USERNAME='user<NUM>'
----

=== Execute the inventory

[source, bash]
----
$ ./run-remote.sh
----

=== Final Configurations

. Log in to the Web Console for the cluster https://master.qcon.openshift.opentlc.com/[HERE]
. Open your DevOps Environment labeled as `labs-ci-cd<USERNAME>`
. Click on the link for *SonarQube* to open it in a new tab/window
. Log in with `admin/admin`
. Generate a new token when prompted and copy it to your clipboard
. Return to the OpenShift Console, click the link for Jenkins
. Log in with your OpenShift Username/Password
. Click on **Manage Jenkins** and then click on **Configure System**
. Locate section labeled **SonarQube servers** and if there is not already a configured server, add one as shown below:
+
===
Name: sonar

Server URL: http://sonarqube:9000

Server version: 5.3. or higher

Server authentication token: <PASTE TOKEN HERE>

SonarQube account login: <BLANK>

SonarQube account password: <BLANK>

<<<
== Load Applications Into CI/CD Environment


<<<
== Exercise 2: Creating A New Vert.x Project
. Ensure that you have Apache Maven >= 3.3.9

=== Download Our Skeleton Project

. Got to https://github.com/rhoar-qcon-2018/insult-service and *FORK* that project
. Clone that *FORK* of the project locally `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USER>/insult-service.git

[NOTE]
====
You CAN use the Vert.x Maven Plugin to create a project from scratch. If you are interested in this, please
refer to the Appendix TODO Vert.x Maven Plugin
====

<<<
=== Set Up For Testing

Vert.x comes with a JUnit-compatible library for doing unit testing called `vertx-unit`. A Open Innovation Labs, we
prefer Behavior Driven Development (BDD), so for this project we will use
http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.1/index.html[SpockFramework]. In order to use Spock, we need a few dependencies
which have already been added in the skeleton:

. Groovy - For writing/running test specifications
. Spock Framework - For BDD
. Objenesis - For Mocking
. ByteBuddy - For Mocking Static/Final

We will also need to add the GMavenPlus plugin and configure the Maven SureFire plugin to be able to
run the Spock tests. This is already configured in your POM from the skeleton project.

<<<
== Create A Jenkins Pipeline
With the latest versions of Jenkins, the new https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[*_declarative pipeline syntax_*]
has become the preferred way in which to define DevOps pipelines. The skeleton project you checked out earlier has a
very complete Jenkins pipeline which we will discuss in detail as we go along.

=== Add The Pipeline To OpenShift
Part of our Ansible automation which was run this morning created a template for pipeline builds. If you go into your
*_CI/CD_* project and click on *_Add to project -> Select from project_* in the top right corner of the
OpenShift web console.

.Add To Project
[#image-add-to-project]
[caption="Figure 4: "]
image::pipeline_build_from_template.png[Add To Project]

This will pop up a dialog which will allow you to choose the template which was created by our earlier automation.

.Select A Template
[#image-select-a-template]
[caption="Figure 5: "]
image::pipeline_build_from_template_2.png[Select A Template]

Selecting the template and clicking *_Next_* will show us a description of the template.

.Template Description
[#image-template-description]
[caption="Figure 6: "]
image::pipeline_build_from_template_3.png[Template Description]

Clicking *_Next_* again will prompt us to fill in the details about the project which we would like to
build via a pipeline.

.Configure Template
[#image-provision-pipeline-from-template]
[caption="Figure 7: "]
image::pipeline_build_from_template_4.png[Configure Template]

Clicking *_Create_* will create a new Build Config in OpenShift with a pipeline strategy.

.Template Processed And Applied
[#image-process-apply-template]
[caption="Figure 8: "]
image::pipeline_build_from_template_5.png[Process And Apply Template]

Finally, clicking *_Close_* will return you to the overview of the CI/CD project. From there, you can navigate to
*_Builds -> Pipelines_* to see your new pipeline build config.

.View The Pipeline In OpenShift
[#image-view-pipeline-for-insult]
[caption="Figure 9: "]
image::pipeline_build_from_template_6.png[Select A Template]

Clicking on the *_insult-service-pipeline_* will bring us to the details page for the pipeline build.

.View The Pipeline Details
[#image-view-insult-pipeline-details]
[caption="Figure 10: "]
image::pipeline_build_from_template_7.png[View The Pipeline Details]

Selecting *_Edit_* from the *_Actions_* menu will allow us to modify the pipeline configuration.

.Modify Insult Service Pipeline
[#image-modify-pipeline-for-insult]
[caption="Figure 10: "]

=== Basic Vert.x Concepts

The https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/[Vert.x Core Documentation] is a really great reference to some of the basic
concepts in Vert.x. We'll cover a few of these things here, but please feel free to go to the official docs for more
in-depth information.

Vert.x implements a *fluent* SPI. This means that for most Vert.x components, you can chain calls together in a nicely
readable manner.

[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
vertx.eventBus()
     .consumer("some-address")
     .toObservable()
     .doOnError(this::errorHandler)
     .subscribe(this::messageHandler);
----

Another core concept of Vert.x is that everything which is done in a Verticle should be done in a non-blocking way.
To support this, Vert.x provides non-blocking implementations of many common operations such as:

* File I/O
* Network I/O
* Database Access
* Message Queues
* HTTP Clients/Servers
* Authentication/Authorization/Audit (AAA)
* Metrics

==== Verticles
From the new project we generated via Maven, we can see that a class called `MainVerticle` was created.
https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_verticles[Verticles] are the basic unit of an application in Vert.x. By default,
Verticles are run single-threaded on an event loop (Reactor Pattern). The one difference between this and other Reactor
Pattern implementations you may have seen before is that Vert.x runs MULTIPLE event loops in parallel, calling it
https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_reactor_and_multi_reactor[Multi-Reactor].

The basic contents of a Vertical are a class definition and a `start` method, as shown here:

[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
package com.redhat.qcon;

import io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle;
import io.vertx.core.Future;

public class MainVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {

    @Override
    public void start(Future<Void> startFuture) {
        startFuture.complete(); // Called once the Vertical is ready
    }
}
----

==== Non-Blocking
Because Vert.x uses event loops for Verticles, we must always ensure that we do not call blocking code and thus block
the event loop. Since Vert.x does not have non-blocking APIs for every situation, it provides a method of
implementing traditional blocking Java code using the `vertx.executeBlocking` method. For example, if we wanted to make a
call via http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jndi/index.html[JNDI] to look up something in an LDAP directory, we
might do something like:

[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
vertx.executeBlocking(future -> {
    // Make our JNDI calls here!
    future.complete(result);
}, result -> {
    // Handle the results of the blocking operation once it completes.
});
----

[#event-bus-intro]
==== Event Bus
The final concept we should introduce for Vert.x is the Event Bus. Since all of the Verticles are implemented to
run single-threaded and potentially across multiple threads/cores in parallel, we need a safe way to share data which
will not cause race conditions or concurrency problems. To facilitate this, Vert.x has an Event Bus through which we
can send/receive messages between Verticles. A simple example of using the event bus might look like:

[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
// Create a consumer and reply when we get PING messages
vertx.eventBus()
    .consumer("ping-timer")
    .toFlowable()
    .doOnEach(m -> System.out.println(m.getValue().body()))
    .subscribe(m -> m.reply(new JsonObject().put("action", "PONG")));

// Set a period timer to send a "PING" message every 300 milliseconds
vertx.timerStream(300)
    .toObservable()
    .map(t -> new JsonObject().put("action", "PING"))
    .subscribe(ping -> vertx.eventBus()
            .rxSend("ping-timer", ping)
            .subscribe(m -> System.out.println(m.body())));
----

<<<
=== Implement Kubernetes Config
Following one of the tenets of https://12factor.net/config[12 Factor Applications], we will want to store our
application's configuration in the deployment environment instead of in our code. Vert.x makes this somewhat painless
by providing a comprehensive set of APIs for loading the application's configuration. In our case, since we are
deploying to Kubernetes, we will use Kubernetes ConfigMaps for our configuration.

Another best practice is that we should practice "test first" development. To further that concept, let's start
by writing a failing test for the feature we intend to implement.

Inside of the `insult-service` project, create the directory path `src/test/groovy/com/redhat/qcon`. Inside of that
directory, we will create the following file.

.src/test/groovy/com/redhat/qcon/MainVerticleSpec.groovy
[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
package com.redhat.qcon

import io.vertx.core.Future
import io.vertx.core.Vertx
import spock.lang.Specification
import spock.util.concurrent.AsyncConditions

class MainVerticleSpec extends Specification {

    def 'Test Vert.x configuration loading'() {
            given: 'An instance of Vert.x'                      {conum-guard-groovy} <1>
                def vertx = Vertx.vertx()
            and: 'An instance of a Vert.x Future'               {conum-guard-groovy} <2>
                def fut = Future.future()
            and: '''An instance of Spock's AsyncConditions'''
                def async = new AsyncConditions(1)              {conum-guard-groovy} <4>

            when: 'We attempt to deploy the main Verticle'      {conum-guard-groovy} <3>
                vertx.deployVerticle(new MainVerticle(), fut.completer())

            then: 'Expect that the correct configuration is found and loaded'
                fut.setHandler({ res ->
                    async.evaluate {                            {conum-guard-groovy} <5>
                        def config = vertx.getOrCreateContext().config()
                        assert res.succeeded()                  {conum-guard-groovy} <6>
                        assert config.hasProperty('insult')     {conum-guard-groovy} <7>
                        assert config.hasProperty('adjective')  {conum-guard-groovy} <8>
                        assert config.hasProperty('http')       {conum-guard-groovy} <9>
                    }
                })

            cleanup: 'Await the async operations'               {conum-guard-groovy} <10>
                async.await(3600)
                vertx.close()
        }
}
----
<1> Set our starting conditions. In this case, we need a running Vert.x instance
<2> Using the `and` block, we can specify additional `given`, `when`, or `then` conditions
<3> Use the `when` block to call the code under test
<4> The `AsyncConditions` class is provided by Spock to allow us to check for one or more asynchronous events
<5> Use the `async.evaluate` to tell Spock that we are waiting for an asynchronous operation
<6> Check to ensure that the future completed successfully
<7> Check to ensure that the config contains a `noun` property
<8> Check to ensure that the config contains a `adjective` property
<9> Check to ensure that the config contains a `http` property
<10> Tell Spock to wait `10` seconds for the async operations to complete

Spock tests are written using a format known as Gherkin. Gherkin formats tests as given-when-then. Spock also has
a format for writing data-driven tests which we will use and explain later.

Now that we have written our test, here's how I would implement the feature code. Inside of the `src/main/java` directory
of our `insult-service` project; w e'll create a new package directory `src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services`.

<9> Merge the loaded configuration into the global Vert.x configuration
<10> Complete the `startFuture` successfully

This example replaces the generic Verticle type with one which has been refactored to use
Reactive Extensions. Most of the rest of this Workshop with rely on using ReactiveX for
our Vert.x code.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the Vert.x ConfigStoreOptions, remember that the order in which ConfigStoreOptions are added
is significant. Items added later will override values from items which were loaded earlier. For example, if the
default config sets `noun.host = 'localhost'`, but the Kubernetes ConfigMap sets `noun.host = '192.168.1.10'`,
the ConfigMap value will take precedence.
====

[NOTE]
====
The single Spock test which we wrote allows us to achieve 100% line AND branch coverage without using ANY dependency
injection because it is a limited form of integration test. Admittedly, the test does not test the Kubernetes ConfigMap
unless it is run inside of Kubernetes/OpenShift, but that would violate the rule of *_Don't test the framework, only test
your code_*. Keep in mind that *I am NOT advocating for 100% coverage*, as that leads to spending a lot of
time and resources for little gain. You should, however, aim to cover all critical paths in your tests.

=== Configure Vert.x Clustering With Infinispan/JGroups
A really impressive feature we can use in Vert.x is it's low-level support for clustering and distributed processing
using the Event Bus. Vert.x supports a few different cluster manager implementations like
https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-hazelcast/java[Hazelcast], https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-infinispan/java[Infinispan],
https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-ignite/java[Apache Ignite], and https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-zookeeper/java[Apache Zookeeper].
Each of these has different use cases, but all accomplish the same goal: Vert.x instances can discover one-another and
then form a mesh-network over the event bus. Once a cluster is formed, the features available include:

* Discovery and group membership of Vert.x nodes in a cluster
* Maintaining cluster wide topic subscriber lists (so we know which nodes are interested in which event bus addresses)
* Distributed Map support
* Distributed Locks
* Distributed Counters

These features are used in some of Vert.x's other features for things like distributed session management for web
applications.


==== Add Clustering Dependencies
For this workshop, since we are using Kubernetes, we will use the Infinispan Cluster Manager by adding the following
dependency

.pom.xml Snippet
[source,xml]
----
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
            <artifactId>vertx-infinispan</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.infinispan</groupId>
          <artifactId>infinispan-cloud</artifactId>
          <version>9.1.3.Final</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.jgroups.kubernetes</groupId>
          <artifactId>jgroups-kubernetes</artifactId>
          <version>1.0.3.Final</version>
        </dependency>
        ...SNIP...
----


When running locally, we can just add `--cluster` to the execution of the fat-jar and Infinispan+JGroups will automatically
discover other Vert.x nodes on the same network segment via Multicast DNS (MCAST_PING).

==== Clustering Inside Kubernetes/OpenShift
When running inside of Kubernetes or OpenShift, we change the config with the system property
`-Dvertx.jgroups.config=default-configs/default-jgroups-kubernetes.xml`.

In our deployment environment, we need to set the `default` service account to have `view` role inside of the
namespace and also set the `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` environment variable. With these changes in place, the Vert.x Pods
will automatically discover one another using the Kubernetes API.


==== Benefits Of Vert.x Clustering
This means that event bus messages can be sent and received across all Vert.x instances. This makes it possible to:

* Distribute capabilities to different microservices in a reactive manner
* Scale microservices independently
* Coordinate across microservices using distributed counters and locks
* Provide a simple API for service communications without the overhead of REST (see https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-service-proxy/java/[Service Proxies])

[NOTE]
====
If you are using an OpenShift cluster which has Multi-tenant networking and UDP multicast enabled, you can skip the
Kubernetes specific config as the cluster will allow Multicast DNS discovery inside of each Namespace just fine.
====

<<<
=== Implement A New https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-service-proxy/java/[Service Proxy]
Vert.x provides a facility to make it easier to consume/produce messages on the Event Bus. In the first
<<event-bus-intro, event bus example>> of sending and receiving on the event bus, we used a producer and a consumer based on
rx-java2. Setting each of these various endpoints can become tedious and does not provide the best developer
experience. Instead, we can use Vert.x Service Proxies to provide an easier way to implement business logic
and then expose that business logic on the event bus in a more consumable manner. These Service Proxy implementations
can also be used in a clustered Vert.x environment to allow us to have simple interactions between services across
multiple microservices. For our workshop, we will be integrating with a few other microservices which provide the Nouns
and Adjectives for our insults. The Noun service is implemented in NodeJS, while the Adjective service is implemented
using Spring Boot.

Something to keep in mind with using Service Proxies is that we should follow the same best practices that we use
when creating REST APIs. Some examples:

* Version your APIs, generally done by using versioned event bus addresses
* Have a strong API contract, often by generating

==== Prepare For The Code Generator

In order for the Vert.x code generation to work, we need to annotate the package which will contain the code to be
processed. We do this by creating a `package-info.java` file. You should place this file deep enough in the hierarchy
that will prevent most of the code from being considered, but high enough that you can process all required code:

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services/package-info.java
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
@ModuleGen(name = "insult", groupPackage = "com.redhat.qcon.insult.services")
package com.redhat.qcon.insult.services;

import io.vertx.codegen.annotations.ModuleGen;
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, you will need to ensure that you enable annotation
processing for the Java compiler. Vert.x uses the annotation processor to generate implementation code
for Service Proxy implementations. Depending on which Vert.x language modules you have included in your
Maven dependencies, Vert.x will generate Service Proxy client code for each supported language runtime like:
JavaScript, RxJava, Kotlin, etc...
====

==== The Interface
All service proxies start with an Interface definition which looks something like this:

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services/InsultService.java
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
package com.redhat.qcon.insult.services;

import io.vertx.codegen.annotations.Fluent;
import io.vertx.codegen.annotations.ProxyGen;
import io.vertx.codegen.annotations.VertxGen;
import io.vertx.core.AsyncResult;
import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;

@ProxyGen
@VertxGen
public interface InsultService {

    static InsultService create(Vertx vertx) {
        return new InsultServiceImpl(vertx, vertx.getOrCreateContext().config());
    }

    static InsultService createProxy(Vertx vertx, String address) {
        return new InsultServiceVertxEBProxy(vertx, address);
    }

    // Business logic methods here!!

    /**
     * Retrieve an insult from the child services and build the insult payload
     * @param insultGetHandler A {@link Handler} callback for the results
     */
    void getREST(Handler<AsyncResult<JsonObject>> insultGetHandler);

    /**
     * Publish a "liked" insult to the Kafka queue to be distributed to all of the other
     * clusters
     * @param insult An insult made up of 2 adjectives and a noun
     * @param insultPublishHandler A {@link Handler} callback for the results
     */
    @Fluent
    InsultService publish(JsonObject insult, Handler<AsyncResult<Void>> insultPublishHandler);
}
----

All of the business logic methods return "void" or the can be fluent and return their service instance.
The two static methods at the beginning are boilerplate for Service Proxies. These methods are used
by the underlying runtime to provide a simple means of wiring up the service proxy.

[NOTE]
====
The business logic methods do not have an access modifier set (e.g. `public`/`private`/`protected`). This means that it
defaults to *_package private_*. By doing this, when we implement unit/BDD tests with Spock we can call those methods
directly in order to facilitate simplified testing.
====

==== Test First Development

When we use the philosophy of _test first_ development, we expect to follow the pattern of:

* [big red]#RED#
* [big green]#GREEN#
* [big yellow]#REFACTOR#

This means that we write a test before we write any code and expect it to fail ([red]#red#). We then write code until
the test passes ([green]#green#). Finally, we plan for any refactoring and start the loop over again.

[NOTE]
====
Using a tool like https://infinitest.github.io/[Infinitest] can be VERY useful to improve your development iterations.
Infinitest _watches_ for changes in your source code and constantly re-runs the appropriate tests when a file changes.
====

Now that we have an interface, we need to create a series of tests for that code. As mentioned at the start, we will be
using http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.1/index.html[Spock Framework] in order to write BDD style _Specifications_.
Spock Specifications are quite easy to write and lend themselves to readability. We start off with a Groovy class which
extends `Specification`.

.src/test/groovy/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services/InsultServiceImplSpec.groovy
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
package com.redhat.qcon.insult.services

import spock.lang.Specification

class InsultServiceImplSpec extends Specification {

}
----

That's the extent of the boilerplate required for writing tests. Spock also supports pre-operations like:

* `setup()` - A method run before EACH TEST
* `setupSpec()` - A method run before the entire test class
* `cleanup()` - A method run after EACH TEST
* `cleanupSpec()` - A method run after ALL of the tests in the class are complete

Any resources which you would want to re-use across tests will need to be defined at the class scope and annotated as
`@Shared`, otherwise Spock will prevent the tests from running. This is to ensure that you don't accidentally re-use
state without being explicit. `static final` field are acceptable too.

.src/test/groovy/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services/InsultServiceImplSpec.groovy
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
package com.redhat.qcon.insult.services

import spock.lang.Specification
import io.specto.hoverfly.junit.core.Hoverfly
import io.specto.hoverfly.junit.core.SimulationSource
import spock.lang.Shared
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject
import io.vertx.core.Vertx

class InsultServiceImplSpec extends Specification {

    @Shared
    Hoverfly hoverfly

    @Shared
    Vertx vertx

    @Shared
    JsonObject proxyOptions

    static final String NOUN_RESPONSE_BODY_ONE =
                                new JsonObject().put('noun', 'noun').encodePrettily()
    static final String ADJ_RESPONSE_BODY_ONE =
                                new JsonObject().put('adj', 'adjective').encodePrettily()
}
----

You will notice that we have defined a `Hoverfly` instance, and we will use this in our tests to simulate the dependent
services which this service will interact with. Hoverfly implements an HTTP proxy which can intercept _simulated_
interactions with an external service. We will use this to simulate both successful and failed responses from the
other microservices so that we can easily test in isolation.

To implement the simulations in Hoverfly, we use the
http://hoverfly.readthedocs.io/projects/hoverfly-java/en/latest/pages/corefunctionality/dsl.html[Hoverfly DSL] to
define a `SimulationSource`.

<1> Create a JsonObject which will cause the service to make requests through the Hoverfly proxy
<2> Instantiate the service to be tested using that configuration
<3> Create an instance of `AsyncConditions` so that we can coordinate with reactive code
<4> Set the simulation to be used
<5> Make the call to the service under test and create a lambda handler which evaluates the results using the `AsyncConditions`
<6> Inside of the `conds.evaluate { }` block, we can place our assertions
<7> Tell `AsyncConditions` to way 10 seconds for the async operations to complete
<8> Use a _data table_ to allow us to run multiple test scenarios with a single block of code
<9> Use the `@Unroll` annotation to show each test iteration as a separate test

If you are at all familiar with Behavior Driven Development (BDD) or have worked a lot in
QA, you will probably recognize the format of the Spock tests... They follow the Gherkin
model of defining specifications. Either _given, when, then_, or _expect, where_.

You'll also notice that we can test 3 different scenarios with the same code by putting
different data into the table. We could add as many of these as we like to ensure we
cover the critical paths.

And when we run our newly created test specification, we should see that all 3 tests fail. [big red]#RED#, just as expected.

==== Creating The Service Implementation

We can now create a class which implements our interface. We have left the service implementation class as a stub so
that we can delve deeper into HTTP clients in the next section.

import io.vertx.core.Handler;

=== Implement REST clients
Vert.x provides both a high-level and low-level method of interacting with HTTP servers. In the core Vert.x package,
there is `vertx.createHttpClient()`, and it allows for very customizable handling of making requests to HTTP servers.
For more simple interactions with HTTP servers, the Vert.x team provides the `vertx-web-client` library. For interacting
with the other microservices via REST, we will use the web client. The simple case of using the web client is
demonstrated below:

==== Vert.x Web Client
.Web Client Example
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
WebClientOptions opts = new WebClientOptions()
                                .setLogActivity(true)
                                .setDefaultHost("localhost")
                                .setDefaultPort(8080)
                                .setProxyOptions(proxyOptions);
WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx, opts);

client.get("/some/path")
        .timeout(3000)
        .rxSend()
        .map(resp -> {                        // Map 4XX and 5XX responses to Exceptions
            if (resp.statusCode()>=400) {
                throw new HttpResponseException(resp.statusCode(), resp.statusMessage());
            }
            return resp;
        })
        .map(HttpResponse::bodyAsJsonObject)
        .subscribe(json -> {
            // Handle successful JSON response body
        },
        e -> {
            // Handle exceptions
        });
----

This is pretty concise code, but it is not terribly readable. The in-line lambdas are also difficult to test in
isolation. Instead, we can extract those into void stateless methods which are simple to test and read.

.Web Client Example
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
private HttpResponse<Buffer> mapErrors(HttpResponse<Buffer> resp)
                                                        throws HttpResponseException {
    // Map 4XX and 5XX responses to Exceptions
    if (resp.statusCode()>=400) {
        throw new HttpResponseException(resp.statusCode(), resp.statusMessage());
    }
    return resp;
}

private void example(Future<JsonObject> httpResponse) {
    WebClientOptions opts = new WebClientOptions()
                                    .setLogActivity(true)
                                    .setDefaultHost("localhost")
                                    .setDefaultPort(8080)
                                    .setProxyOptions(proxyOptions);
    WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx, opts);

    client.get("/some/path")
            .timeout(3000)
            .rxSend()
            .map(this::mapErrors)
            .map(HttpResponse::bodyAsJsonObject)
            .doOnError(httpResponse::fail)
            .subscribe(httpResponse::complete);
}
----

This code is simple to test and easier to read. As we go forward, this is the pattern I will advocate.

==== Implementing the Insult Service Using Web Client
Now, let's implement some methods so that we can make requests to our associated microservices and retrieve the results.

These futures can then be composed in another method:

<1> Map errors to an exception
<2> Combine the 3 results into a single JSON object
<3> When an exception happens, map it to a failed future
<4> Map successful JSON to a succeeded future

`CompositeFuture.all(...)` tells Vert.x to run ALL of the specified methods and return when ANY of them fails or ALL
of them succeed. All of the methods are run non-blocking and potentially in parallel. In this case, we request 2
adjectives and a noun. We then pipe the the result through a handler which combines the 3 successful results into a
single `JsonObject`.

==== Consuming A Service Proxy API From Another Vert.x Service

There is a third microservice implemented for you which we will need to interact with. This service is implemented in Vert.x and uses Service Proxies. Since it is implemented with Service Proxies, we can consume that service using the Service Proxy client which is generated for us by Vert.x's Code Generation.

<<<
First, add the library for the service proxy client:

.pom.xml
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]

        </dependency>
        <!-- SNIP -->
----

This artifact is available from the Nexus server which is on our workshop WiFi network. If you cannot get this artifact, you can compile and install it locally by running `mvn clean package install` inside of the `kafka-service` project. Next, we can create an instance of the Service Proxy from our application.

public class InsultServiceImpl implements InsultService {

    public InsultServiceImpl(io.vertx.core.Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {

        kafka = KafkaService
                    .createProxy(Vertx.newInstance(vertx), "kafka.service");    {conum-guard-groovy} <1>

        Future<Void> fut = Future.future();                                     {conum-guard-groovy} <2>
        handler.handle(fut);                                                    {conum-guard-groovy} <3>
        kafka.rxPublish(insult)
                .toObservable()
                .doOnError(fut::fail)                                           {conum-guard-groovy} <4>

        return this;
    }

    // -- SNIP --
----
<1> Create an instance of the proxy at the class scope (See note below)
<2> Create a Future with which to complete the handler
<3> Set the handler to use the Future
<4> Set the Rx error handler to fail the Future on error
<5> Set the completion of the Rx stream to complete the Future

[IMPORTANT]
====
When creating an instance of a Service Proxy client, you MUST ensure that the address
on the event bus matches the address on the service which binds that address. If the
addresses do not match, you will be sending messages into an unused message queue.
====

[NOTE]
====
When compiling Service Proxy code, the code generator will generate client code in
every currently supported language library currently on the classpath. This means that
if your have `vertx-lang-js`, you will get client interfaces in JavaScript and Typescript.
If you have `vertx-rx-java-2`, you will get Rx'ified versions of your service proxy.
Adding `vertx-lang-scala` will generate the library in Scala and so on. This is a
supremely powerful feature for integration and API sharing.
====

==== Refactor To Implement Circuit Breakers

Since we are operating in a microservices environment, we would be remiss if we did not
implement circuit breakers to ensure timely responses from our applications. Vert.x has
an add-on module for implementing Circuit Breakers in the Vert.x non-blocking and
reactive environment.

==== Refactor Test Specifications To Account For New Capability

Back to our _test first development_ idea, we need to refactor our test to account for
our new capability. We'll modify the test result for the delayed response test so that
we expect a circuit breaker result instead of a normal success response.

When we run this modified test, we expect that the last 2 scenarios will fail because we have not yet implemented
the circuit breakers.

Let's have a look at how we would add circuit breakers to the
method which calls the adjective service.

== Implement REST API

=== Using OpenAPI 3 Spec file to create REST API in Vert.x

In order to use the OpenAPI Router Factory in Vert.x we must first create a new API
specification using OpenAPI v3. For our Insult service, we will write a simple REST
API specification using YAML.

.src/main/resources/insult-api-spec.yaml
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]

[NOTE]
====
The YAML itself is only somewhat helpful for understanding the API. It is VERY useful
to visualize the Spec in https://editor.swagger.io/[Swagger Editor]. It is highly
recommended that you paste the code above into that editor to view the API specification.

=== Adding The OpenAPI Router Factory To The MainVerticle

Earlier, we created the skeleton of the `MainVerticle` class. Now we will expand that
service to wire up the service proxy we have written and we will expose that service
via both REST and WebSockets. Using the code generated by Vert.x, that websocket
interface to the service can be used from JavaScript front-end applications to make
API calls in a completely Reactive manner.

The first step is to create an instance of the OpenAPI3RouterFactory:

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/MainVerticle.java
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
    public static final String INSULT_SERVICE_ADDRESS = "insult.service";
    public static final String INSULT_API_SPEC_YAML = "/insult-api-spec.yaml";

    /**
     * Begin the creation of the {@link OpenAPI3RouterFactory}
     *
     * @param config The config loaded via the {@link ConfigRetriever}
     * @return An {@link OpenAPI3RouterFactory} {@link Future} to be used to
     *         complete the next Async step
     */
    private Maybe<OpenAPI3RouterFactory> provisionRouter(JsonObject config) {
            // Merge the loaded configuration into the config for this Verticle
            loadedConfig = config().mergeIn(config);

            if (LOG.isInfoEnabled()) {
                    LOG.info("Config Loaded: {}", loadedConfig.encodePrettily());
            }

            // Instantiate the Insult Service and bind it to the event bus
            InsultServiceImpl nonRx = new InsultServiceImpl(vertx.getDelegate(), loadedConfig);
            new ServiceBinder(vertx.getDelegate()).setAddress(INSULT_SERVICE_ADDRESS)
                            .register(com.redhat.qcon.insult.services.InsultService.class, nonRx);

            // Create the OpenAPI3RouterFactory using the API specification YAML file
            return OpenAPI3RouterFactory.rxCreate(vertx, INSULT_API_SPEC_YAML).toMaybe();
    }
----

This method returns a `Maybe` which allows us to compose it upon success or handle
errors.

Second, we need to use the OpenAPI3RouterFactory to wire up our Service Proxy to the
API endpoints. We also need to export certain Event Bus addresses to enable those
service proxy interfaces for the front-end web application.

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/MainVerticle.java
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
    /**
     * Wire the {@link OpenAPI3RouterFactory} into the HTTP Server
     *
     * @param factory The {@link OpenAPI3RouterFactory} created in the previous step
     * @return An {@link HttpServer} if successful
     */
    Maybe<HttpServer> provisionHttpServer(OpenAPI3RouterFactory factory) {
            // Configure the HTTP Server options
            // - Listen on port 8080 on all interfaces using HTTP2 protocol
            HttpServerOptions httpOpts = new HttpServerOptions()
                            .setHost(loadedConfig.getJsonObject("http").getString("address"))
                            .setPort(loadedConfig.getJsonObject("http").getInteger("port")).setReuseAddress(true)
                            .setSoLinger(0).setLogActivity(true);

            InsultService service = InsultService
                            .newInstance(new ServiceProxyBuilder(vertx.getDelegate()).setAddress(INSULT_SERVICE_ADDRESS)
                                            .build(com.redhat.qcon.insult.services.InsultService.class));

            // Map out OpenAPI3 route to our Service Proxy implementation
            factory.addHandlerByOperationId("getInsult", ctx -> service.rxGetREST()
                            .subscribe(
                                    json -> sendResult(ctx, json),
                                    e -> errorHandler(ctx, e)));

            // Map out OpenAPI3 route to our Service Proxy implementation
            factory.addHandlerByOperationId("health", ctx -> service.rxCheck()
                            .subscribe(
                                    json -> sendResult(ctx, json),
                                    e -> errorHandler(ctx, e)));

            Router api = factory.getRouter();

            Router root = Router.router(vertx);

            CorsHandler corsHandler = CorsHandler.create(".*").allowedHeader("Access-Control-Request-Method")
                            .allowedHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")
                            .allowedHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers").allowedHeader("Content-Type")
                            .allowedMethod(HttpMethod.GET).allowedMethod(HttpMethod.POST)
                            .allowedMethod(HttpMethod.HEAD).allowedMethod(HttpMethod.PUT)
                            .allowedMethod(HttpMethod.OPTIONS).allowedMethod(HttpMethod.CONNECT);

            root.route().order(0).handler(corsHandler);
            api.route().order(0).handler(corsHandler);

            root.mountSubRouter("/api/v1", api);

            BridgeOptions bOpts = new BridgeOptions()
                            .addInboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("insult.service"))
                            .addOutboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("kafka.service"))
                            .addOutboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("insult.service"))
                            .addOutboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress(FAVORITES_EB_ADDRESS));

            SockJSHandler sockHandler = SockJSHandler.create(vertx).bridge(bOpts);

            root.route("/eventbus/*").handler(sockHandler);

            return vertx.createHttpServer(httpOpts).requestHandler(root::accept).rxListen().toMaybe();
    }
----

Pay special attention to the `BridgeOptions` object. This is how to tell Vert.x which
addresses can communicate over the websocket bridge. Unless explicitly allowed,
sending/receiving messages to/from other event bus addresses is prohibited.

Another thing to mind is that we are calling an `errorHandler` and a `sendResult` method
which have not yet been defined. These methods, defined below, allow us to separate out
the functionality in a way that is easier to read and easier to test.

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/MainVerticle.java
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
    /**
     * Send a successful HTTP response
     *
     * @param ctx  The {@link RoutingContext} of the request
     * @param json The {@link JsonObject} body to be sent in the response
     */
    private void sendResult(RoutingContext ctx, JsonObject json) {
            ctx.response().putHeader(CONTENT_TYPE.toString(), APPLICATION_JSON.getMimeType())
                            .setStatusCode(OK.code()).setStatusMessage(OK.reasonPhrase())
                            .end(json.encodePrettily());
    }

    /**
     * Send an unsuccessful HTTP response
     *
     * @param ctx The {@link RoutingContext} of the request
     * @param e   The error which caused the failure
     */
    private void errorHandler(RoutingContext ctx, Throwable e) {
            ctx.response().setStatusCode(INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.code())
                            .setStatusMessage(INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.reasonPhrase()).end(e.getLocalizedMessage());
    }
----

Finally, the new methods get wired into the `start` method so that they are all executed
in sequence during the start of the application.

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/MainVerticle.java
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
    @Override
    public void start(Future<Void> startFuture) {
        initConfigRetriever()
            .flatMap(this::provisionRouter)
            .flatMap(this::provisionHttpServer)
            .subscribe(
                    server -> startFuture.complete(),
                    startFuture::fail);
    }
----

That's really all of it! We've created our microservice with Vert.x, Service Proxies,
and OpenAPI3RouterFactory! Some things you may or may not have noticed along the way:

* We use very few conditionals in our code, instead we use error handlers via RxJava2
* We have avoided using in-line lambdas which are not only difficult to test, but also harder to read
* We used the Service Proxy capability which allows us a simplified way of consuming services over the event bus
* We DID NOT use ANY dependency injection, but we still have a sufficiently decoupled code base which can be easily tested!

[NOTE]
====
Vert.x is *_COMPLETELY_* capable of being used in a dependency injected container environment
like Spring, CDI, Guice, etc... Vert.x can integrate easily in any of these frameworks.
The reason we demonstrate that Vert.x can be coded without dependency injection is to
show the high level of flexibility which Vert.x gives us. It is also my personal opinion
that if you CAN avoid dependency injection, you have one less bit of _magic_ that can
be difficult to debug.
====

=== Implement A Health Check REST Endpoint
In order to take full advantage of containers and Kubernetes/OpenShift we should define
a health check REST endpoint which the orchestrator can poll to ensure that an
application is running properly. This is trivial to implement in our application.

Since we have already defined a `/health` endpoint in our OpenAPI specification, we only
need to write the service proxy implementation and wire it to our existing Router. Let's
add the `check` method to our Service Proxy interface:

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services/InsultService.java
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
    /**
     * Check the health of this service
     * @param healthCheckHandler A {@link Handler} callback for the results
     */
    void check(Handler<AsyncResult<JsonObject>> healthCheckHandler);
----

And write a test to ensure that it is working as expected.

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services/InsultServiceImplSpec.groovy
[source, groovy, subs=attributes+]
----
@Unroll
def "Test health check endpoint: #description"() {
    setup: 'Create Mocks for circuit breakers'
        def adjBreaker = Mock(CircuitBreaker) {
            1 * state() >> adjective
        }
        def nounBreaker = Mock(CircuitBreaker) {
            1 * state() >> noun
        }

    and: 'Create an instance of the service under test'
        def underTest = new InsultServiceImpl(vertx, httpClientConfig)

    and: 'Replace the circuit breakers with Mocks'
        underTest.adjBreaker = adjBreaker
        underTest.nounBreaker = nounBreaker

    and: 'An instance of AsyncConditions'
        def conds = new AsyncConditions(1)

    expect: 'We call the health check method'
        underTest.check({ res ->
            conds.evaluate {
                assert res.succeeded() == status
                assert res.result().getString("noun") == noun
                assert res.result().getString("adj") == adjective
            }
        })

    where: 'The following data table is used.'
        description            | status     | noun      | adjective
        'Both breakers closed' | true       | CLOSED    | CLOSED
        'Adj breaker open'     | false      | CLOSED    | OPEN
        'Noun breaker open'    | false      | OPEN      | CLOSED
        'Both breakers open'   | false      | OPEN      | OPEN
}
----

And the actual implementation code:

.src/main/java/com/redhat/qcon/insult/services/InsultServiceImpl.java
[source, java, subs=attributes+]
----
/**
 * Check the health of this service
 * @param healthCheckHandler A {@link Handler} callback for the results
 */
@Override
public void check(Handler<AsyncResult<JsonObject>> healthCheckHandler) {
    JsonObject status = new JsonObject();

    String nounState = nounBreaker.state().name();
    String adjState = adjBreaker.state().name();
    status.put("noun", nounState)
            .put("adj", adjState);

    if (nounState.contentEquals("OPEN") || adjState.contentEquals("OPEN")) {
        status.put("status", "OK");
    } else {
        status.put("status", "DEGRADED");
    }
    healthCheckHandler.handle(Future.succeededFuture(status));
}

== Quality Analysis And Project Health Using SonarQube

When you have pipeline automation for your development projects, it becomes easier to add more automated controls to
your development processes. Whereas in a legacy development organization, each quality process you add can significantly
slow down your development productive, when you use pipelines it is very low cost to "bake" quality into your
development processes. Our first initiative to add quality to our code is to use https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube].
SonarQube is a "continuous inspection" tool to validate the quality of the code being written. SonarQube comes with a
number of language bindings which a large number of rules to help us avoid common coding mistakes or anti-patterns. The
Ansible automation which we used earlier has already deployed the SonarQube server into our CI/CD environment and wired
it into our Jenkins CI/CD server to be used with our pipeline. Now, all that we need to do is add some lines to our
Jenkinsfile to tell it to analyze the code with SonarQube.

.insult-service/Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
    ... SNIP ...
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn test'
      }
    }
    stage('Quality Analysis') {
      steps {
        script {
          withSonarQubeEnv() {
            sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
          }
          def qualitygate = waitForQualityGate()
          if (qualitygate.status != "OK") {
             error "Pipeline aborted due to quality gate failure: ${qualitygate.status}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Build Image') {
    ... SNIP ...
----

You will see that we have added a new `stage` to our pipeline which runs the SonarQube Maven plugin to analyze our code
for quality issues. The Sonar Maven plugin also captures the results of our unit tests and code coverage for inclusion
in our metrics around quality.

== Security Analysis Using OWASP Zed Attack Proxy

Functional tests and static code analysis are only part of the story when we consider how we can improve resilience and
quality in our application development. Another important consideration is *_Securiry_*. We want to evaluate our
software systems to ensure that the applications we deploy meet our standards for security and compliance. In this case,
we will use the tool https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project[Zed Attack Proxy] or ZAP.

ZAP is a tool which allows an automation tool like Selenium (Web app functional end-to-end testing) to make it's requests
through ZAP and ZAP will monitor for well known security issues like the
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project[OWASP Top 10]. ZAP can also run a *_baseline_* scan which
will *_spider_* your web application to try to find security issues. For our purposes we will use JUST the baseline scan.

== Vulnerability Analysis Using OWASP Dependency Check

Another tool from OWASP which can leverage is the Dependency Check. It evaluates all of our dependencies in the Maven
POM file and checks them versus the NIST CVE list to see if there are unpatched security vulnerabilities in our
libraries.

=== Create A New Vert.x Project Using The Vert.x Maven Plugin

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the skeleton project, these steps are not required
====

. Create an `insult-service` directory under the `rhoar-kubernetes-qcon-2018` top-level directory
. Run the following command

This will create a new Maven POM file populated based on the values you entered during the setup.

After the POM file has been created, we will need to add some additional libraries for this microservice:

* vertx-web-api-contract
* vertx-rx-java2
* vertx-service-proxy
* vertx-sockjs-service-proxy
* vertx-config-kubernetes-configmap
* vertx-codegen
* vertx-lang-js

All of these are within the `io.vertx` Maven group ID and covered via the dependency management setup
from the initialization process, so we can put them in without versions as follows:
